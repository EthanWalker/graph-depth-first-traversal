Depth First Traversal
=====================

This is an example program demonstrating Depth first traversal of a graph.

The graph it searches is provided by the included Graph.txt file in the following format:

+ Lines beginning with a '#' character will be ignored as comments
+ blank lines will also be ignored
+ It is assumed that the file will be valid and contain data on
+ 10 nodes for the graph.
+ Data on each node consists of the following on separate lines
+ NodeID -- an integer
+ NodeData -- a character array of up to 10 characters
+ Number of links -- an integer giving the number of links to other nodes
+ The next N lines will list the NodeIDs of the links
